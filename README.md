## Hello ğŸ‘‹ ğŸ˜„

Thank you for your time and consideration. This is my submission for the Hatchways Front-end assessment.

The only thing I was not able to figure out was to get the tags to persist past a refresh, despite that not being in the requirements. All stated features are present, and styling is consistent to the images provided as guidelines.

Just run NPM Install and it should be good to go. No external libraries were used.
